Here's a handy KQL (Kusto Query Language) query to track BitLocker key activities such as accessing, reading, deleting, or adding keys in your AuditLogs:

üîç What Does This Query Do?
This query scours the AuditLogs table for any operations associated with "BitLocker key" and retrieves specific details about these operations, including:
TimeGenerated: When the action occurred.
OperationName: The name of the operation performed.
Identity: Who performed the action.
Result: The outcome of the action.
TargetResources: The resources that were accessed.
InitiatedBy: Who initiated the action.
By implementing this query, you can get a comprehensive list of instances where BitLocker keys were accessed, read, deleted, or added, enhancing your ability to detect and respond to potential security threats.

AuditLogs
| where OperationName contains "BitLocker key"
| project TimeGenerated,OperationName, Identity, Result, TargetResources, InitiatedBy

This is specifically for the UK time zone and for operations related to deleting and reading BitLocker keys.
